## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- A PocketBase instance (local or hosted)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd vue-clip
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Edit `.env` and set your PocketBase URL:
```
VITE_POCKETBASE_URL=http://localhost:8090
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## PocketBase Setup

### Database Schema

Create a collection named `clips` with the following fields:

- `slug` (Text, Required, Unique)
- `content` (Text, Required)

### API Rules

Set the following permissions for the `clips` collection:

- **List Records**: `""` (Nobody)
- **View Record**: `""` (Everybody)
- **Create Record**: `""` (Everybody)
- **Update Record**: `""` (Nobody)
- **Delete Record**: `""` (Everybody)

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

### Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/          # Static assets and global CSS
â”œâ”€â”€ components/      # Reusable Vue components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ LoadingSpinner.vue
â”œâ”€â”€ views/           # Page components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CreateView.vue
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ReadView.vue
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SuccessView.vue
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ NotFoundView.vue
â”œâ”€â”€ router/          # Vue Router configuration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js
â”œâ”€â”€ App.vue          # Main app component
â””â”€â”€ main.js          # App entry point
```

## Deployment

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist/` directory with optimized static files.

### Static Hosting

Deploy the `dist/` directory to any static hosting service:

- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the `dist` folder or connect your Git repository
- **Vercel**: Import your project and deploy
- **GitHub Pages**: Upload the `dist` contents to your gh-pages branch

### Important: SPA Configuration

Since this is a Single Page Application (SPA), you need to configure your hosting provider to redirect all requests to `index.html`. This ensures that refreshing the page on routes like `/my-clip` works correctly.

#### Netlify
Create a `public/_redirects` file:
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

#### Vercel
Create a `vercel.json` file:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```
